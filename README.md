# TSL2585 Breakout Board

This repository contains the [KiCad](http://kicad.org/) project
with the complete circuit schematics and PCB layout for a breakout
board that supports a certain series of 1.8V light sensors from
[AMS](https://ams-osram.com/).

The supported selection of sensors all appear to be pin-compatible,
interface compatible, and only differ in minor ways. These sensors
include:

* [TSL2520](https://ams.com/en/tsl2520) - Light sensor with Clear and IR channels
* [TSL2521](https://ams.com/en/tsl2521) - Light sensor with Clear and IR channels, and flicker detection
* [TSL2585](https://ams.com/en/tsl2585) - Light sensor with Photopic, UV-A, and IR channels, and flicker detection
* [TCS3410](https://ams.com/en/tcs3410) - Light sensor with Color channels and flicker detection
